# Error-Propagation
!!! Only works on Windows currently !!!

This program takes the class Rules from error_propagation.py and puts them into a GUI so a user can interact with it without knowing how it works. This is just meant as a convenience to use these rules.

Double-click the error_propagation.bat file to get the GUI running, then it should prompt you for a rule you want to use and then the values needed to calculate the equation for the given rule.
